1. https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-django-with-postgres-nginx-and-gunicorn-on-ubuntu-20-04
Link gives step by step explanation for deploying django app to digitalocean ubuntu 20.4 server
Example files are in this directory:
    a) gunicorn.service files will not be changed.
    b) gunicorn.service file examples:
        c) User: linux user that have sudo permission
        d) Group: www-data (for serving static files from nginx)
        e) WorkingDirectory is working directory that manage.py, db.sqlite3 and other files located
        f) ExecStart gunicorn execution path (for detecting which gunicorn in django virtualenv file)
2. If nginx can not serve static files and returns 403 Forbidden error this means nginx have
no enough permission for reading this file. One solution for this is change STATIC_ROOT
directory to /home/<username>/<project_name> in order collectstatic can collect this files there.
3. If nginx gives 502 Bad Gateway error this means gunicorn service is not running or error from web server.
4. myproject is nginx configuration file:
    a) listen 8000 (for local pc)
    b) for serving media files location /media/ should point to MEDIA_ROOT directory in django
    for example, it is good for local pc to serve media files from static directory like this:
    /home/<username>/<project_name>/static for static and /home/<username>/<project_name>/media for media files
